## Introduction
The Himalayan Expeditions dataset includes records of climbs in the Himalayas from r min(exped$year, na.rm = TRUE) to r max(exped$year, na.rm = TRUE).
It was published by The Himalayan Database and shared through Tidy Tuesday on January 21, 2025.
-How success rates differ by season?
-How elevation relates to success?
-Which countries or years had the most expeditions?

## Discussion
Figure 1 shows that higher elevations generally mean lower success rates. Spring expeditions tend to succeed more often than those in other seasons at similar heights.
Figure 2 confirms that spring has the highest success rate, followed by autumn. Other seasons have lower success, likely due to worse weather.
In summary, season and altitude strongly affect expedition success in the Himalayas.
